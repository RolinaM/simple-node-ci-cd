Simple Node.js CI/CD Pipeline
Welcome to the Simple Node.js CI/CD project! 🎉 This repository showcases how to set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions, Node.js, and Jest for testing.

🚀 What is This Project About?
This project is a basic Express.js server that returns a friendly message. But the real magic lies in automating the testing and deployment process using CI/CD workflows!

🎯 Features
✅ Express.js Server – A simple API returning "Hello, CI/CD!"
✅ Automated Testing – Uses Jest & Supertest for API tests
✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD – Automatically runs tests & deployments
✅ Deployable – Ready for deployment on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean

🛠 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
sh
git clone https://github.com/RolinaM/simple-node-ci-cd.git
cd simple-node-ci-cd

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
sh
npm install

3️⃣ Run the Server Locally 🌍
sh
npm start
##Your server should be running at: http://localhost:3000

4️⃣ Run Tests 🧪
sh
npm test
##This will execute Jest tests to ensure the server is working correctly!

🤖 How CI/CD Works in This Project
1️⃣ Push Code to GitHub → GitHub Actions automatically starts the CI/CD pipeline.
2️⃣ Run Automated Tests → Jest verifies that everything works.
3️⃣ Deployment (Optional) → Once tests pass, the server can be deployed to a cloud provider.

🚀 GitHub Actions Workflow
Your CI/CD pipeline is defined in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml.

🔹 On Every Push:

Installs dependencies
Runs Jest tests
Deploys only if all tests pass
